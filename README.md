# AI-in-Road-Traffic
In this repository we'll see codes which can be applied to real life traffic on roads. How AI can help automate tasks for great experiences in traffic. 
Use person_detection.py along with YOLO-Object detection github repository(link given in references). Here only thing i have done is to remove all classes and keep only person. Also i have used it to run a buzzer whenever a human crosses in front of the camera.
